# Herb 2.0

This is a remake of Simbad's original Node.js Discord bot. Herb 1.0 was a venture I took on after a free CodeAcademy course and is actually a pile of JavaScript feces. Herb 2.0 is something I'm actually proud of. It is the culmination of everything I've learned about JavaScript from [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/). 

# What is Herb Bot?

Herb Bot is Simbad's Discord bot written in Node.js. Simbad is a player group in the game Elite: Dangerous. We use Herb to moderate and make life easier on Discord. Herb 2.0 is written with the Klasa Discord bot framework.
